Recursion is nothing but when function calls itself until a specified condition is met

Stack overflow occurs when there is numerous function calls waiting

stack overflow happens when a program uses more stack memory than the system allows
because too much memory is allocated on the stack usually beacause toop deep or infinite Recursion

like every program has two main memory areas

stack used for fucntion calls / local variables, parameters/ return addresses
it grows and shrinks automatiacally as fucntionsare called and return

heap used for dynamic memory
